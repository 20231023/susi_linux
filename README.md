Hardware for SUSI AI

This project aims at creating an implementation of Susi, capable to run on Hardware Devices in a headless mode.
It will enable you to bring Susi AI intelligence to all devices you may think like a Speaker, Car etc.

**Current Status**
- Voice Detection working with Google Speech API.
- Voice Output working with Festival TTS.
- Susi AI response working through Susi AI API Python Wrapper(https://github.com/fossasia/susi_api_wrapper)

**Roadmap**
- Enable "Susi" Hotword Detection
- Offline Voice Detection (if possible with satisfactory results)
- Provision of more services for online Voice Detection and make it a user choice.
- Add more/better voice/tts engines to give more realistic feel to Susi Voice.
- Add hardware specific options like Susi Wake Button.

**Setting Up**
- Read [setup.md](setup.md)
